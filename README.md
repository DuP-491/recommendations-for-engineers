# Recommendations for Engineers
All of my recommendations for aspiring engineers in a single place, coming from various areas of my interest. The principal scope supports data science, programming, python, math, cybersecurity, business, and productivity.

The list also aggregates and extends most of the suggestions from [my blog posts](https://pawelcislo.com/), where some of the entries come from a different language (🇵🇱). Although it's my personal list, don't hesitate to create a pull request if I missed something interesting or if there is a dead link.

Inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list thing.
